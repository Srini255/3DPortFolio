# 3D Portfolio Project

This project is built with React and Vite, providing a fast development environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint integration.

Compared to the default Vite React template, this portfolio showcases interactive 3D elements and custom UI components tailored for personal branding.

Key features and differences:

- Utilizes [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) for efficient development and Fast Refresh.
- Integrates advanced 3D rendering libraries (such as Three.js) to display portfolio items in an immersive way.
- Customizes ESLint rules to enforce code quality and consistency specific to this project's needs.
- Designed for scalability and easy integration of new portfolio sections.

## Recommendations

For production use, consider adopting TypeScript and enabling type-aware linting. Refer to the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for guidance on integrating TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) into your workflow.
